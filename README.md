# Toolkit 3: Doxygen
Here is my third and final toolkit assignment; providing improved documentation for the employee files. 

# How To Run The program
Since this project is based off of the documentation instead of the actual functioning code, simply go into the html file and type in "open index.html". 

# Challenges
The biggest issue I encountered was the fact the lab computers did not have Doxygen installed, and the fact that when signed into cs1 it adds additional hoops to open the index. To get around this, I brought my laptop to the lab and had it signed into cs1. With this, I could interchange between the two terminals whenever I needed to run certain commands.
